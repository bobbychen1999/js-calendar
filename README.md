This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Bobby Chen and Martin Zhang's calendar website

### How do I get set up? ###

* In a browser, type the url: 
* http://ec2-18-222-151-162.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~martinzhang/mod5/calendar/calendarmain.html
* Preferrably Chrome or FireFox
* this should direct you to the calendar
* You can register an account
* or you can use username: test and password: test to log in
* click "previous month" and "next month" to move along the time line
* type in the event content and the exact moment to add/edit/delete/share/group events
* click "Logout" to log out
* The already existed registered users are martinzhang(pw: martinzhang), rynn(pw:rynn), test(pw:test)

### Creative Portions ###

* Users can tag an event with a particular category and enable/disable those tags in the calendar view: 
* On top of the page there is a button saying either "hide category" or "show category", it is your option
* clicking that button would change the option. 
* To use the category, when creating events, there is a field "category", you can either type or select
* Users can share their calendar with additional users:
* when creating events in the field called "otheruser", type the username of the user you want to share to
* button "Share event", clicking that button would add that event to the user's calendar
* Shared event should not be deleted and edited
* Users can create group events that display on multiple users calendars: 
* when creating events there is a button "Create group event", clicking that button would create that event for each registered user
* All users can edit/delete the group event
